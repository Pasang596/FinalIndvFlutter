# NailsCare
Flutter Project

## Description And Features
Hamro Care is a hospital management application for “Hamro Care” hospital. This is built for people who want appointments in this hospital. The patient can register using their identity which helps the salon later after the patient gets an appointment. Although every detail is very important, the profile picture is not necessarily needed to be something that represents them. Although patients will not be banned permanently, they can be banned temporarily if found misusing the application. 
 
## Features of this project
The project I'll be working on for this module is a hospital appointment booking app called "Hamro Care," which includes features such as: 
1)	Patients can book an appointment with or with a specific salon.
2)	Patients can check, and delete their schedule and their previous schedules as well.
3)	Patients can Change, delete, edit their profile, and personal details, and change their password.
4)	Salons can see their appointments with the patients and give the prescription and feedback on their patients.

Some of the Challenges Faced during the development of this project are:
1) had difficulty while fetching the data which were in the different format like "List inside of list inside of list"
2) In near future, i might implwment the chatting system, calling and video system.

## Project Architecture

## WaterFall Methodology
The waterfall model is a standard system development life cycle model that uses a linear and sequential approach to design a system. Because the model progresses regularly from one phase to the next in a downward direction, it is called a waterfall model. The output of one phase is used as the input of the next step in this paradigm. Every step must be finished before the next begins, and the stages must not overlap. This helps us to return to the previous phase easily.

## Design Pattern: Model-View-View Model (MVVM):
The Model-View-View Model (MVVM) pattern is a software design paradigm that separates program logic from user interface controls. Microsoft architects Ken Cooper and John Gossman designed MVVM, often known as model-view-binder.
MVVM, like many other design patterns, helps to organize code and separate applications into modules, making development, updating, and reusing code easier and faster. In Windows and web graphics presentation software, the motif is frequently utilized.
